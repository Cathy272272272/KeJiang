An app for testing how much your destiny is bound with famous soccer player Diego Costa ("盛世美颜“ -- The man so gorgeous that the entire world kneels down before his glamour).
This is an App developed using Android studio and can be ran on your Android phone or any virtual devices provided by Android Studio.

Upon entering the App, the user will have two options: A "Start" button and a "Browse petite Costa's photo" button. When clicking the "Start" button, a video showcasing the compelling beauty of Costa will be played, giving the user a most sensual experience. Then, the user will be directed to a button "test which Costa is soul-bonded with you", which, upon clicking, will present a random photo from an carefully assorted collection of nine most appealing photos of beautiful Costa, with the caption saying "Ah, this is the Costa that is soul-bonded with you", rendering the user a pleasant surprise. The randomization is achieved through a simple random-number algorithm. Alternatively, if "Browse petite Costa's photo" button is clicked at the beginning, the users will be given the liberty to freely explore the entire collection of nine Costa's photo and have a most memorable time of their life.

GridLayoutManager. Disabled action bar for optimized UI representation
Graphic and Video visualization: Extended RecyclerView.Adapter to a customized Adapter and inherited
its features; Embedded playable video media using mediaController and VideoView.
